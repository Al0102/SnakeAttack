# Why?

I'm making this to learn multiplayer connections through one of everyone's favourite classic games, Snake.
Also going to be submitting this to and devlogging on [Flavortown by HackClub](https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=daf30528491d1c7247c805a34ac3a5c6df735cba6b5bb30622f96815229a1d81JmltdHM9MTc2OTI5OTIwMA&ptn=3&ver=2&hsh=4&fclid=1f093888-9d9d-6493-39fd-2e559cb065c6&psq=flavortown&u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly9mbGF2b3J0b3duLmhhY2tjbHViLmNvbS8).

# When?

Should finish a basic build by end of January to mid-February depending on how much work/school I've got to do.
